# twitisowall

## Intro:

Another Twitter wall with lots of great javascript libraries.
You may look what it looks like following my gh-pages: http://akervern.github.com/twitisowall/

For now, this is still a work in progress project.


## Libraries:
 * [ICanHaz.js](http://icanhazjs.com/): a really nice client-side templating using [{{ mustache }}](http://mustache.github.com/). (MIT)
 * [jQuery](http://jquery.org): Who don't know? (MIT)
 * [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/): a so nice javascript date library. (MIT)
 * [Isotope](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/): a jQuery plugin for magical layout. ([see website](http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/license.html))

## How to use:
 * Clone
 * Open index.html
 * That's all ... :)

Of course, you'll have more details when it will be available as a Javascript module !
